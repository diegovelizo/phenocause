\title{Metadata for phenocause example genetic data}
\format{
A \code{data.frame} with 5,000 rows and 22 columns:
\describe{
\item{\code{sample.id}}{A unique identifier for each individual.}
\item{\code{population}}{The simulated population label: Peruvian in Lima, Peru (PEL); Colombian in Medellin, Colombia (CLM); Mexican Ancestry in Los Angeles, California (MXL); Puerto Rican in Puerto Rico (PUR); Iberian in Spain (IBS); Yoruba in Ibadan, Nigeria (YRI); Han Chinese in Beijing, China (CHB); and individuals with Mexican ancestry from the 1000 Genomes Project (MXB).}
\item{\code{PC1} to \code{PC20}}{The first 20 principal components of genetic variation.}
}

\usage{
phenocause.metadata
}
\description{
A data frame containing metadata for the 5,000 simulated individuals. This documentation also provides the complete generation details for the associated genetic data, which is stored externally as GDS files.
}
\details{
The associated genetic data was generated using a detailed pipeline to simulate realistic patterns of admixed ancestry. The principal components in this metadata object were calculated from that genetic data.

\strong{1. Simulation pipeline}

The raw DNA sequences and genealogies were simulated using \code{msprime} (Kelleher et al., 2016; Baumdicker et al., 2022). The resulting tree sequence data was exported to VCF format. These VCFs were then processed using \code{bcftools} and \code{PLINK} (Chang et al., 2015) to create a final, analysis-ready dataset containing only biallelic SNPs that passed quality control (MAF >= 1\% and LD pruning via \verb{--indep-pairwise 500 50 0.2}). Finally, the pruned VCF for each chromosome was converted to the GDS format using \code{SeqArray::seqVCF2GDS()}.

\strong{2. Msprime simulation parameters}

\itemize{
\item \strong{Sample composition}: A total of 5,000 individuals were simulated from the 8 populations listed in the \verb{@format} section.
\item \strong{Demographic model}: The simulation used the complex demographic model of admixed Latin American populations developed by Medina-Muñoz et al. (2023).
\item \strong{Recombination maps}: The human recombination maps for chromosomes 20, 21, and 22 from genome build GRCh38 were used. To create a smaller example dataset, only the first one-third of each chromosome's genetic length (in cM) was simulated.
\item \strong{Coalescent model}: The Discrete-Time Wright-Fisher (DTWF) model was used. This model was chosen over the standard Hudson model because it more accurately handles the large sample sizes and recent admixture events present in the demographic model, preventing known genealogical distortions (Bhaskar et al., 2014; Nelson et al., 2020).
\item \strong{Mutation model}: A constant mutation rate of \eqn{1.25 \times 10^{-8}} per base pair per generation was used, with the Jukes-Cantor (JC69) nucleotide substitution model (Jukes & Cantor, 1969).

\section{Associated Genetic Data}{

This metadata corresponds to the genetic data stored in three GDS files within the package. Their paths can be retrieved as follows:
\code{example_gds_paths <- system.file(paste0("extdata/example.chr", 1:3, ".gds"), package = "phenocause")}
}

\examples{
# 1. Get paths to the associated GDS files
gds_paths <- system.file(
  paste0("extdata/example.chr", 1:3, ".gds"),
  package = "phenocause"
)

# 2. Open one GDS file to extract sample IDs
gds <- SeqArray::seqOpen(gds_paths[1])
sample_ids_in_gds <- SeqArray::seqGetData(gds, "sample.id")
SeqArray::seqClose(gds)

# 3. Load the metadata object
data(phenocause.metadata)

# 4. Print a small section of the metadata
phenocause.metadata[1:6, 1:8]

# 5. Test that the sample IDs in the metadata and GDS file match
all_match <- all(sort(phenocause.metadata$sample.id) == sort(sample_ids_in_gds))
cat("Sample IDs in metadata and GDS file match:", all_match, "\n")
